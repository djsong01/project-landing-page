# Webpage Design Project

## Overview

This project is part of my learning journey to build a well-structured web pages from scratch. The goal is to recreate a web design provided in image format using HTML and CSS. The design includes two reference images:
- A full-page mockup
- A breakdown of fonts and colors used

This project challenges me to apply everything I’ve learned so far—structuring HTML and using CSS for layout and styling.

## My Approach

- **Plan first**: I started by reviewing the two images and breaking the design down into major sections (there are 4 main sections plus a footer).
- **Structure with HTML**: I focused on getting all the content in place first before worrying about the styling.
- **Style with CSS**: Once the structure was set, I applied styling using one stylesheet. I leaned heavily on Flexbox, which came in handy for layout.
- **Iterate**: I made adjustments as I styled—going back and forth between HTML and CSS to get things closer to the original design.
- **Personalization**: I plan to substitute my own content and images where appropriate to make this more reflective of my style.

## What I'm Practicing

- Translating a visual design into working code
- Working with Flexbox for layout
- Using semantic HTML
- Making design decisions when exact specs aren't provided
- Managing a project in Git and GitHub (init, commit, push)
- Trusting the process and problem-solving without peeking at other solutions
